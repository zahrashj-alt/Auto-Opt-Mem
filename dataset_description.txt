1. Table7 - Reward function values for eight experiments.
   Columns:
   - Experiment ID
   - Latency (ms)
   - Cost ($)
   - QoS (%)
   - Utilization (%)
   - Reward (normalized multi-objective function)

2. Table9 - Comparison of Auto Opt Mem with Sizeless [17] and FnCapacitor [18].
   For each approach, eight experimental values are included for:
   - Latency (ms)
   - Cost ($)
   - QoS (%)

These datasets are simulated and were generated directly from experimental tables in the research paper.
They support reproducibility and sharing on GitHub as supplementary datasets.
