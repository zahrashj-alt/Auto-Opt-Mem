# Auto-Opt-Mem
A deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous memory configuration approach for serverless computing (Auto Opt Mem).


This repository contains the datasets and experiment codes for the Auto Opt Mem method, a reinforcement learning–based approach for autonomic memory configuration optimization in serverless computing.

The experiment codes are provided as plain text files (Notepad format) inside the experiments folder. These files represent the original scripts used and executed in Google Colab. Therefore, they may not run directly on a local Python environment without adjustments, due to dependency and version differences.

The datasets stored in the dataset folder were extracted directly from the tables of the research paper. These are datasets created for reproducing the experimental results and comparing the proposed Auto Opt Mem method with other approaches.

This repository is published to enhance research transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of the paper’s results.
